# Instructions for Final Report.

## The purpose of this report is to probe students understanding of the course material.

This will be a group report.

Students will utilize the [Testplan template](TestPlanTemplate.docx).

Students will populate the testplan for a skywater130 chip.

Students will assume that only the [ASMD_Multiplier](../../asmd/src/asmd_multiplier_flat.v) is burned onto the chip,
ignoring all other components present.

Students will present the testplan as well as the verification plan as part of an oral final exam.
