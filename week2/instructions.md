# Instructions for week 2.

Break up into groups of 2.

Open up the ASMD Multiplier from Week 1 [ASMD_MULTIPLIER](../week1/src/asmd_multiplier_flat.v).

- Inspect the verilog code for functionality.

- Open and inspect the generated asmd multiplier [logic requriment document](asmd_multiplier_logic_req.docx) which follows the  [logic requirement template](logic_req_template.docx).

You can also inspect the [uart logic requirement document template](../uart/doc/uart_tx_rx_logic_req.docx) for another example. 

- Each group must create a functional logic test plan, following the [test plan template](test_plan_template.docx)

see [uart test plan template](../uart/doc/uart_tx_rx_test_plan.docx) for a clear example.

Both members must commit and push the testplan to their class repository branch.
