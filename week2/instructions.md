# Instructions for week 2.

Break up into groups of 2.

Open up the ASMD Multiplier from Week 1 [ASMD_MULTIPLIER](../week1/src/asmd_multiplier_flat.v).

- Inspect the verilog code for functionality.

- One group member creates a requirement document, following the [uart logic requirement document template](../uart/doc/uart_tx_rx_logic_req.docx). 

- The other member creates a functional logic test plan, following the [uart test plan template](../uart/doc/uart_tx_rx_test_plan.docx).

Both members must commit and push the two documents to their class repository branch.
